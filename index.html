            <p>Games are an integral part of the holistic development which direct one to be competitive while keeping the spirit of honesty and camaraderie alive. Keeping with the same, the final Inter-House Football Match was played on August 5, 2016 between the Senior Boys (Classes IX to XI) of Emerald and Sapphire in an electrifying environment. Both the teams tried to outshine each other on the field to show their mettle. Emerald House emerged victorious. The team could be seen jubilantly celebrating its victory after the match. Well done Emerald House!!!!!!</p>
